        <h1>Let me explain?</h1>
        <h2>If you ever wondered why I put a song in the playlist just ask, or now you dont have to.</h2>
        <p>The 1 -blackbear - You jumped in and started asking where we were going, hopefully in a year off to the valey. You started to hammer a nail into my heart, and I added this song thinking in the perspective of you. I never wanted to ruin anything, and you showed me what better was. I will never let my doubts run me again.</p>
        <p>1-800-273-8255 - Our Last Night - </p>
        <p>After All - Beartooth - </p>
        <p>All I Want - A Day To Remember - I had been searching for such a long time to find what felt like home. With each place we moved it hammered in that home is where the heart is. You might be good at hiding your thoughts and feelings but I know you understand what I meant by that. You have been all I want</p>
        <p>All Star - Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! - You got me into them, maybe not the furthest but any time I played this song I felt close to you again. Even before you moved in, anything that brought that feeling was worth keeping around.</p>
        <p>All The Kids Are Depressed - Jeremy Zucker - When we first started falling I knew you weren't just like anyone else, I was worried we would just be a fling."All my friends are popping pills and I don't think that they're wrong, I think too much, We drink too much"every time I hear that I have you come into my head and reassure me that I don't need anything to help. Reality might be shitty but you are more than worth it, you just remind me of who I am</p>
        <p>Another Level - Hollywood Undead - </p>
        <p>Antivist - Bring Me The Horizon - 1)Justin 2) That Whole trip, It for sure will be one I will NEVER forget.&#x1F606;</p>
        <p>Ass Back Home - Secrets - </p>
        <p>Back To Me - Of Mice And Men - I might make mistakes and I might be the biggest dumbass ever but you are well worth the work and effort and commitment. You never strive for anything less than perfect and you know what you deserve. When I hear this song I think of if we ever broke up things wouldn't be the same as they were, I'd always still be striving for a partnership with you &#128536;</p>
        <p>BASMF - 3OH!3 - You make me feel like a Bad Ass Stupid Mother Fucker in the best way possible and I will never stop being your stupid fucker &#128536;</p>
        <p>Beach House - The Chainsmokers - </p>
        <p>Beauty And The Beast - (lotta people together) - </p>
        <p>Before It Burned - Quin XCII - </p>
        <p>Believer - Imagine Dragons - </p>
        <p>Bitch Lasagna - Another plethora of people - Who doesn't like an adventure to Rigaberto's, You find a way to make every day life fun.</p>
        <p>Blank Space - I Prevail - It was truly an amazing concert and I am glad I got to have my first with you. We might have had our first actual fight here</p>
