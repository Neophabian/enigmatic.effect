        <h1>Let me explain?</h1>
        <h2>If you ever wondered why I put a song in the playlist just ask, or now you dont have to.</h2>
        <p>The 1 -blackbear - You jumped in and started asking where we were going, hopefully in a year off to the valey. You started to hammer a nail into my heart, and I added this song thinking in the perspective of you. I never wanted to ruin anything, and you showed me what better was. I will never let my doubts run me again.</p>
        <p>1-800-273-8255 - Our Last Night - </p>
        <p>After All - Beartooth - </p>
        <p>All I Want - A Day To Remember - I had been searching for such a long time to find what felt like home. With each place we moved it hammered in that home is where the heart is. You might be good at hiding your thoughts and feelings but I know you understand what I meant by that. You have been all I want</p>
        <p>All Star - Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! - You got me into them, maybe not the furthest but any time I played this song I felt close to you again. Even before you moved in, anything that brought that feeling was worth keeping around.</p>
        <p>All The Kids Are Depressed - Jeremy Zucker - When we first started falling I knew you weren't just like anyone else, I was worried we would just be a fling."All my friends are popping pills and I don't think that they're wrong, I think too much, We drink too much"every time I hear that I have you come into my head and reassure me that I don't need anything to help. Reality might be shitty but you are more than worth it, you just remind me of who I am</p>
        <p>Another Level - Hollywood Undead - </p>
        <p>Antivist - Bring Me The Horizon - 1)Justin 2) That Whole trip, It for sure will be one I will NEVER forget.&#x1F606;</p>
        <p>Ass Back Home - Secrets - </p>
        <p>Back To Me - Of Mice And Men - I might make mistakes and I might be the biggest dumbass ever but you are well worth the work and effort and commitment. You never strive for anything less than perfect and you know what you deserve. When I hear this song I think of if we ever broke up things wouldn't be the same as they were, I'd always still be striving for a partnership with you &#128536;</p>
        <p>BASMF - 3OH!3 - You make me feel like a Bad Ass Stupid Mother Fucker in the best way possible and I will never stop being your stupid fucker &#128536;</p>
        <p>Beach House - The Chainsmokers - </p>
        <p>Beauty And The Beast - (lotta people together) - </p>
        <p>Before It Burned - Quin XCII - </p>
        <p>Believer - Imagine Dragons - </p>
        <p>Bitch Lasagna - Another plethora of people - Who doesn't like an adventure to Rigaberto's, You find a way to make every day life fun.</p>
        <p>Blank Space - I Prevail - It was truly an amazing concert and I am glad I got to have my first with you. We might have had our first actual fight here, I feel like there is so much behind this song with us it would have felt wrong to not put it in your playlist &#128517;</p>
        <p>Boyfriend - Issues - Idk listen to it &#128514;</p>
        <p>Breaking Free - Skillet - You showed me this song being a good friend and trying to help me work through my shit. Little did you know that it had a lot more of an impact than you thought. You solidified what I knew but had forgotten.</p>
        <p>Broken Lives - Our Last Night - </p>
        <p>Call Out My Name - Seraphim - This song came onto my spotify when you had first forced me to switch to it. You had no idea that I meant what some of the song was saying. I remember hoping that it wasn't love for why you were with me. You deserved better and it would have been easier that way, I felt confused and I wanted a future with you. I was convincing myself that you didn't want what I could offer while you simulaniously made me fall deeper and deeper in love with you. This song had a lot of insecurities in it when we started. I started falling for you in freshman year. Litteraly after every single girlfriend I have wanted to try things with you and karma really must have had my back because I don't know how, or why but you chose me. You have no idea what that means to me and how much that has changed me as a person.</p>
        <p>Caught In The Storm - Our Last Night - I found this while I wasn't balsy enough to actively talk to you. It was so stupid of me and every time we would see each other we stayed just how we had been and it was like we never even skipped a beat.</p>
        <p>Chaos - I Prevail - When you told me this song made you think of me I was speechless. You understood a part of me no one else did but we had never really talked about it. I have always been homesick for a place I was never sure existed. You have shown me more times than I can count why you are my home. I Love You</p>
        <p>Clever - Beartooth - </p>
        <p>Cliffs - Rosenfeld - I Fell. I fell so hard in love with you nothing else mattered and it made me feel like I had jumped off a cliff and missed the ground. You were everything I ever wanted and you are still showimg me that YOU are what I want</p>
        <p>Closer - Seaway - Every time we talked I felt like we got closer and closer. You make me feel like I wont age. The fountain of youth is in those baths you brew and the love you shower me in</p>
        <p>comethru - Jeremy Zucker</p>
        <p>Cool Again - Shoffy - </p>
        <p>Demons - We Are Fury - I put it in here originally because I felt like I had part about me that i had to get rid of and that I couldn't bring into us. There were, I did bring some in with me still, but I will never stop working on improving and making sure you feel loved, respected and most of all that you feel happy.</p>
        <p>Diamond Girl - Set It Off - You got me into Set it Off. You will always be my Diamond. I don't know why anyone let you go, I for sure wont be. You are a precious gem that was hand crafted to make life a brighter place</p>
        <p>Dirty Mind - 3OH!3 - I can't help it, You really do have a power over me. You are the only person I have ever had eyes for (no need to worry about that polygamist bullshit)</p>
        <p>Don't Threaten Me With A Good Time - Panic! At The Disco - To be honest, this isn't the one I wanted to put into the playlist but it's what made it haha, you had said I only get one of their songs though and told me to keep it. You bring an impulse factor into my life that I didn't know I needed. You always make days out or events or anything we need to do fun. I can still be weird with you and not feel judged. You complete me</p>
        <p>Dopamine - Bliss n Eso - </p>
        <p>Drew Barrymore - Bryce Vine - People always said we made a cut couple before we even started to date. You have always been the woman I wanted in my life. Let the other girls be jealous, only you and I will know what is shared between us. There is nothing like it.</p>
        <p>Drugs - Eden - I was afraid that you wouldn't understand what I was going through. I never thought you could have been this understanding and I acted out in wrong and hurtfull ways because of that. I hope one day you will forgive me. I put this song into the playlist when I was broken and trying to hide it. You saw through my bullshit and pulled me out of it. I will forever be greatfull and thankfull you are my friend and lover.</p>
        <p>Elevate - Papa Roach - You lift me higher to places I never thought I could be. I couldn't have done this last year of accomplishments without you. You have shown me all it takes is a deep breath, a good night and an amazing partner. Everything else will fall into place.</p>
        <p>Everybody Hates Me - The Chainsmokers - You kept me humble and pridefull. You made sure I recognised what I had been able to do. You also showed me work isn't everything and there was a limit to when a life does need to start.</p>
        <p>Everything Goes Black - Skillet - </p>
        <p>Every Time You Leave - I Prevail</p>
        <p>Fall - Palisades</p>
        <p>Fire and Fury - Skillet - I remember sending this to you when the album came out. You got me into Skillet and I remember hearing it and imediately thinking of you and I just missed you. I was texting you and missing you at the same time. I had a taste of home every friday night when we would go out bowling and I'd be missing you again. </p>
        <p>Flare Guns - Quinn XCII - You warned me I wasn't ready and that there was better out there. You tried to convince me that you weren't for me and sometimes I wonder if you were trying to convince yourself instead. You are my forever. No matter how late, no matter how tired I was whenever you wanted I showed up soaking in every second of your beautiful smile and just falling in love with you more and more.</p>
        <p>Follow You - Bring Me The Horizon - I will always follow you. Fighting or not you are what makes me happy, no matter what the circumstances are you are all I need.</p>
        <p>For The Glory - All Good Things - This song makes me think of the life we are building together, You make me proud to be here and be with you. You make me feel like royalty.</p>
        <p>Ghost - Badflower - I got so upset when you said this song made you think of me. You pointed out the line and I got so much more annoyed. How could you know me in ways I don't talk about. Yeah haha, this one is written on my skin, I GUESS. You have always seen me. It honestly scares the everliving shit out of me. How could you be so perfect for me.</p>
        <p>God Damnit - Illenium - When I first found this song I was counting inventory at wallmart. I started bawling the second it started the first verse. I know how bad I messed up. I don't believe and I never will believe the size of your heart. I will never believe the type of woman you are. This song hit everything I didn't know I needed to say to you. I know I haven't talked much about why I did what I did, it's embarrasing and I feel childish. But seeing how I hurt you. It destroyed me.. Since then I don't know why you gave me a second chance, I don't know why you ever even thought about me again but i will never stop being greatfull. You have given me the best, well everything. I Love You Haley, with all my heart.</p>
        <p>Good Things Fall Apart - Illenium - I've always had a slight doubt that you want me. I know the guys you've been with, I don't feel very talented or skilled or driven. </p>
